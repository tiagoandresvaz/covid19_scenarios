<h1>About COVID-19 Scenarios</h1>

This web application serves as an interactive planning tool for COVID-19 outbreaks in communities across the world. It
implements a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with additional categories for individuals exposed to the
virus that are not yet infectious, severely sick people in need of hospitalization, people in critical condition, and a
fatal category.

## Basic assumptions

The model works as follows:

- Susceptible individuals are exposed/infected through contact with infectious individuals. Each infectious individual
  causes on average $R_0$ secondary infections while they are infectious.
  - Transmissibility of the virus could have seasonal variation which is parameterized with the parameter "seasonal
    forcing" (amplitude) and "peak month" (month of most efficient transmission).
- Exposed individuals progress to a symptomatic/infectious state after a latency period. This progression happens in
  three stages to ensure the distribution of times spent in the exposed compartment is more realistic than a simple
  exponential model.
- Infectious individuals recover or progress to severe disease. The ratio of recovery to severe progression depends on
  age.
- Severely sick individuals either recover or deteriorate and turn critical. Again, this depends on the age.
- Critically ill individuals either get admitted to ICU (if space is available), are placed in an overflow compartment,
  or receive palliative care. Younger age-groups are given preferential access to ICU.
- Individuals in ICU either return to regular hospital wards or die. Again, this depends on the age and on whether they
  receive intensive care or not.
- Individuals in palliative care die, which could also represent nursing home deaths or deaths at home.

The individual parameters of the model can be changed to allow exploration of different scenarios.

COVID-19 is much more severe in the elderly, so proportion of elderly in a community is therefore an important
determinant of the overall burden on the health care system and the death toll. We collected age distributions for many
countries from data provided by the UN and make those available as input parameters. Furthermore, we use data provided
by the epidemiology group of the

## Seasonality

We don't yet know how seasonality will affect COVID-19 transmission; that said, many respiratory viruses such as
influenza, common cold viruses (including other coronaviruses) have a pronounced seasonal variation in incidence, in
part driven by climate variation through the year. We model this seasonal variation using a sinusoidal function with an
annual period. This is a simplistic way to capture seasonality.

For further information on the possible effects of seasonality, see _Remaining parameters_ below.

    Figure 2. Seasonal variation in transmission rate is modeled by a cosine. The model allows to specify the average
    R0, the amplitude of the cosine (seasonal forcing), and the month of peak transmission.

## Transmission reduction

The tool allows one to explore temporal variation in the reduction of transmission by infection control measures.
Control measures can be specified as time intervals with start and end dates, during which transmission is reduced by a
certain amount.

Several studies attempt to estimate the effect of different aspects of social distancing and infection control on the
rate of transmission. A report by [Wang et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1) estimates
a step-wise reduction of $R_0$ from above 3 to around 1 and then to around 0.3 due to successive measures implemented in
Wuhan. [This study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/27/13174) by Litvinova et al. investigates the effect of school
closures on influenza transmission.

## Details of the model

Qualitatively we model the epidemic dynamics with the following subpopulations:

- Susceptible individuals [$S$] are exposed to the virus by contact with an infected individual.
- Exposed individuals [$E$] progress towards a symptomatic state on average time $t_l$
- Infected individuals [$I$] infect an average of $R_0$ secondary infections. On a time-scale of $t_i$, infected
  individuals either recover or progress towards hospitalization.
- Hospitalized individuals [$H$] either recover or worsen towards a critical state on a time-scale of $t_h$. They either
  progress towards critically ill individuals in the ICU or individuals in palliative care that will die.
- Critical individuals [$C$] model ICU usage. They either return to the hospital state or die [$D$] on a time-scale of
  $t_c$
- Recovered individuals [$R$] cannot be infected again.

Subpopulations are delineated by age classes, indexed by $a$, to allow for variable transition rates dependent upon age.
Quantitatively, we solve the following system of equations to estimate hospital usage:

<div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS_{a}(t)}{dt} & = - N^{-1}\beta_a(t) S_a(t)\sum_{b}I_b(t) \\
\frac{dE_{a}^1(t)}{dt} & = N^{-1}\beta_a(t) S_a(t)\sum_{b}I_b(t) - 3E_{a}^1(t)/t_l \\
\frac{dE_{a}^2(t)}{dt} & =  3E_{a}^1(t)/t_l - 3E_{a}^2(t)/t_l \\
\frac{dE_{a}^3(t)}{dt} & =  3E_{a}^2(t)/t_l - 3E_{a}^3(t)/t_l \\
\frac{dI_{a}(t)}{dt} & = 3E_{a}^3(t)/t_l - I_a(t)/t_i \\
\frac{dH_{a}(t)}{dt} & = (1-m_a) I_a(t)/t_i + (1-f_a) C_a(t)/t_c - H_a(t)/t_h \\
\frac{dC_{a}(t)}{dt} & = c_a H_a(t)/t_h - C_a(t)/t_c \\
\frac{dR_{a}(t)}{dt} & = m_a I_a(t)/t_i + (1-c_a)H_a(t)/t_h \\
\frac{dD_{a}(t)}{dt} & = f_a C_a(t)/t_c + p_a H_a(t)/t_h
\end{aligned}
$$

</div>

The parameters of this model fall into three categories, which determine the relative rates of different outcomes: (1) A
time-dependent infection rate $\beta(t)$; (2) Time scales of transition to a different subpopulation $t_l$, $t_i$,
$t_h$, $t_c$; and (3) Age-specific parameters $m_a$, $c_a$, $p_a$, and $f_a$. Here the latency time from infection to
infectiousness is $t_l$, the time an individual is infectious after which he/she either recovers or falls severely ill
is $t_i$, the time a sick person recovers or deteriorates into a critical state is $t_h$, and the time a person remains
critical before dying or stabilizing is $t_c$. The fraction of infectious that are asymptomatic or mild is $m_a$, the
fraction of severe cases that turn critical is $c_a$, the fraction of severe cases that go straight into palliative care
is $p_a$, and the fraction of critical cases that are fatal is $f_a$.

One aspect of the model is not reflected in the above system of equations: If the number of critically ill patients
exceeds the capacity of ICU, they are placed in an overflow category $O$. Individuals in this category die at a higher
rate. Otherwise, the flow is the same as for category $C_a$. Patients are allocated to the overflow category in a manner
that gives priority to younger patients.

The transmission rate $\beta_a(t)$ is given by:

<div>

$$
  \beta_a(t) = R_0 \zeta_a M(t) (1+\varepsilon \cos(2\pi (t-t_{max})))/t_i
$$

</div>

where $\zeta_a$ is the degree to which particular age groups are isolated from the rest of the population, $M(t)$ is the
time course of mitigation measures, $\varepsilon$ is the amplitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility, and
$t_{max}$ is the time of the year of peak transmission.

## Parameter estimation

With the prevalence of COVID-19 data for many regions, we now estimate a _few_ select parameters for independent regions
that provide public data. Specifically, we estimate the following default scenario parameters:

- $R_0$ value
- The date and initial size of the epidemic start
- Fraction of cases caught by the region's testing infrastructure

These parameters are estimated from both the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related fatalities
reported. The estimation is accomplished by the minimization of the least squared difference between our model
predictions and the empirical data. Specifically:

- We define an objective function that:
  - Takes as input a set of model parameters to simulate.
  - Integrates the equations of motion described above.
  - Returns the sum of squared residuals between the given empirical data and the result of ODE integration.
  - Weights the residuals to the cumulative fatalities relative to case data to account for the difference in
    magnitudes.
- The objective function is minimized with respect to the above variable parameters using the Nelder Mead algorithm.
- Scenarios are populated with these individualized parameters

## Remaining parameters

- Many estimates of $R_0$ are in the [range of 2-3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7001239/) with some
  estimates pointing to considerably [higher values](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675v1).
- The serial interval--that is, the time between subsequent infections in a transmission chain--was initially
  [estimated to be 7-8 days](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316). More recent research now suggests a
  serial interval of 5-6 days (see [Ganyani et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815v1)).
- The China CDC compiled [extensive data](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51)
  on severity and fatality of more than 40 thousand confirmed cases. In addition, we assume that a substantial fraction
  of infections, especially in the young, go unreported. This is encoded in the columns "Confirmed [% of total]".
- Seasonal variation in transmission is common for many respiratory viruses but the strength of seasonal forcing for
  COVID19 is uncertain. For more information, see a [study by us](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20224) and by
  [Kissler et al](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031112v1).
